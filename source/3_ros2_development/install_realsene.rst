Intel RealSense Camera Installation
-------------------------------------

This section provides instructions for installing and configuring Intel RealSense cameras on the Renesas RZ/V2H RDK board for ROS2 applications.

TODO: Need to verify the installation steps and compatibility with the current ROS2 distribution, since we can't apply the existing patch to the common kernel from Distro team. Instead, we will use the eSDK to rebuild the kernel with the required Linux Image.
