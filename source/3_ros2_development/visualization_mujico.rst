Mujico Visualization
--------------------------

Mujico is a simulation platform designed for robotics development, particularly in the context of ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2).

It provides a virtual environment where developers can test and validate their robotic applications without the need for physical hardware.

TODO: Add step-by-step instructions on how to set up and use Mujico for ROS2 development on the RZ/V2H RDK platform.
