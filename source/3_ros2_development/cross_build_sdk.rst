Cross-build with Yocto SDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. caution::

    Be aware of potential **ABI mismatch errors** when using the Yocto SDK method.

    Refer to the :ref:`ABI mismatch appendix <abi_mismatch>` for more details.


To cross-build ROS2 applications for the RZ/V2H RDK platform, we will use the Yocto SDK provided with the RZ/V2H RDK Linux image.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complete the :ref:`Common docker environment setup <docker_sdk_setup>` step as described in the **System Configuration** section.

After this step, the Docker container is expected to be fully set up with the Yocto SDK installed.

Access the Docker container terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ docker exec -it [name_of_docker_container] bash

Inside the container, go to your ROS2 workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd <path-to-your-ROS2-workspace>

.. tip::

   ``$ROS2_WS`` is the default workspace directory set by the Dockerfile.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd $ROS2_WS

  Environment variables set in the Docker container:

  - ``$ROS2_WS``: Default ROS2 workspace directory.
  - ``$TOOLCHAINS_WS``: Directory for cross-compilation toolchain files.

Copy cross.cmake file to your workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cp $TOOLCHAINS_WS/cross.cmake $ROS2_WS/

.. note::

   On the first time create the container, the default toolchain files are already installed to the ``$ROS2_WS``

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before cross-building ROS 2 applications, ensure that the ROS 2 workspace is fully set up with all necessary dependency packages.

Refer to the :ref:`Common ROS2 Workspace structure <common_ros2_workspace_structure>` to gain some típ for setting up the ROS2 workspace for your development.

Make sure to include all required ROS2 packages in the ``src/`` directory of your workspace.

The worksapce structre:

.. code-block:: text

    ros2_ws/
    ├── src/                  # Source code for ROS 2 packages
    │   ├── package_1/
    │   ├── package_2/
    │   └── ...
    ├── build/                # Build output directory (generated by cross-colcon-build command)
    ├── install/              # Installation directory (generated by cross-colcon-build command)
    └── log/                  # Log files (generated by cross-colcon-build command)

Cross-build Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using ``cross-colcon-build``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Use the ``cross-colcon-build`` command to build ROS 2 packages for the RZ/V2H RDK.

The ``cross-colcon-build`` script is a wrapper around the standard ``colcon build`` command that performs the following steps:

- Checks if a ``cross.cmake`` toolchain file exists in the current working directory.
- Unsets the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` variable to avoid conflicts with the cross-compilation environment.
- Loads the cross-compilation environment by sourcing the appropriate SDK setup script.
- Runs ``colcon build`` with the necessary CMake arguments for cross-compilation, along with any user-provided arguments.

The ``cross-colcon-build`` command functions similarly to the standard ``colcon build`` command, but with key differences tailored for cross-compilation.

Instead of building binaries for your current host architecture, it targets the **RZ/V2H (arm64)** platform using the configured **Yocto SDK** and **toolchain**.

Usage Guide
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Simply replace ``colcon build`` with ``cross-colcon-build`` in your workflow.

You can pass any additional arguments supported by ``colcon build`` directly to ``cross-colcon-build``.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cross-colcon-build --packages-select rzv_demo_dexhand

This command ensures that all necessary environment variables and toolchain settings are correctly applied for cross-compiling your ROS 2 packages for the **RZ/V2H** platform.

.. note::

   For more details, refer to the ``env.conf`` file.

   To obtain the default ``cross.cmake`` file, copy it from the ``$TOOLCHAIN_WS`` directory.

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After successfully cross-building the ROS2 applications, deploy the built packages to the RZ/V2H RDK target device.

Refer to the :ref:`ROS2 Deployment <ros2_deployment>` section for detailed instructions on deploying the applications to the target device.
