ROS2 Application Development with RZ/V2H RDK
==============================================

This section covers the development of ROS2 applications using the Renesas RZ/V2H RDK board.

Target `ROS2 Jazzy <https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/index.html>`_ running on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and RZ/V2H RDK.

When developing ROS2 applications for the Renesas RZ/V2H RDK platform, it is essential to set up the development environment correctly.

We provide a guide to help you get started with ROS2 development, including setting up the necessary tools, **cross-building applications**, and deploying them to the RZ/V2H RDK board.

The following topics are covered in this section:

- **Sample Applications:** Examples of ROS2 applications that can be built and executed on the RZ/V2H RDK.
- **Repositories and Packages:** Information about available RZ/V ROS2 packages.
- **ROS2 Development:** Instructions on the development workflow for ROS2 applications, including cross-build and deployment.
- **Other Concepts:** Additional concepts and advanced topics related to ROS2 development.
- **Appendix:** Supplementary information.
