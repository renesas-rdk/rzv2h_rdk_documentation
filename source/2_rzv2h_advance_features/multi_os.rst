RZ/V Multi-OS
-----------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RZ/V Multi-OS feature allows the RZ/V2H platform to run multiple operating systems concurrently.

This capability is particularly useful for applications that require separation of tasks, such as running a real-time operating system (RTOS) alongside a general-purpose OS like Linux.
